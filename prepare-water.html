                    Water provisions are crucial during disasters, wars, or other emergencies, as water is essential for
                    human survival. The average adult requires approximately 3 liters (or about 13 cups) of water daily
                    for drinking, while children need around 1-2 liters depending on their age, size, and activity
                    level. In emergencies, additional water is often required for hygiene and cooking, making access to
                    clean water even more critical. Sources of water can include stored supplies, natural bodies of
                    water, or collected rainwater. However, in many situations, this water may need to be filtered or
                    treated to remove contaminants. Boiling is one of the most effective methods to kill pathogens,
                    while portable filters, purification tablets, and UV sterilizers can be used for rapid and portable
                    solutions. Ensuring access to clean water minimizes the risk of dehydration, disease, and other
                    health issues, making it a cornerstone of emergency preparedness and response.
                </p>
                <h4>Water Purification Tablets</h4>
                <p>
                    Water purification tablets are a practical and essential tool in emergency scenarios where access to
                    clean drinking water is limited. These tablets, typically made of chlorine, iodine, or similar
                    disinfectants, effectively eliminate harmful bacteria, viruses, and parasites from water, making it
                    safe to consume. Lightweight and portable, they are ideal for situations where boiling water or
                    using filtration systems is impractical, such as during disasters, war zones, or while on the move.
                    Each tablet usually purifies 1-2 liters of water, offering a quick and efficient solution to meet
                    survival hydration needs, especially when natural or stored water sources are contaminated.
